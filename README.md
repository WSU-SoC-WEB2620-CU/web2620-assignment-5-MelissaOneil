# Starter Project
A starter project powered by Webpack.

## Instructions
After you clone (download) this repository from GitHub, run the following command to install the required NPM packages. You only need to do this once.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser (Chrome and/or Firefox are recommended) to view your site. With the development server running, any change you make is compiled and seen automatically in the browser.

**NOTE**: All your HTML/CSS/Javascript code should go into the correct folders/files under the `src/` folder. Do not touch the contents of the `dist/` folder; they are generated by Webpack based on what you have under the `src\` folder when you run the deployment command below. 

When you are done with development and ready to deploy your application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will compile everything you have under the `src/` folder into the `dist/` folder. You then copy the contents of the `dist/` folder including subfolders into your web server.
